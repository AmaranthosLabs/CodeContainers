# CodeContainers
  CodeContainers are a specific template series for creating code in VSCode

## Language Matters
  Most languages need a specific environment in which to run.
  Keeping this environment consistent has always been problematic.
  
### Templates
- DotNetCore
- Haskell
- Idris
- Jekyll
- SpecFlow

Most containers are [NixOS](https://nixos.org) but some work better in other distros.
