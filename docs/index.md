# CodeContainers
  CodeContainers are a specific template series for creating code in Visual Studio / VSCode

## Language Matters
  Most languages need a specific environment in which to run.
  Keeping this environment consistent has always been problematic.
  This solves that problem, completely. We have device generic sandboxing and network isolation.
  
### Templates
- DotNetCore
	- Api
	- Aggregate
	- Library
- SpecFlow
- Jekyll
- Typedefs
- Statebox
- Haskell

- Idris2

Most containers are [NixOS](https://nixos.org) but some work better in other distros.
